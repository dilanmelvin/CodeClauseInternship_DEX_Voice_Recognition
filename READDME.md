    ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**
    Ensure Python 3.x is installed and set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
    Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask SpeechRecognition pydub
    ```
    > **Note:** You might need to install `ffmpeg` or `libav` for audio processing with `pydub`.

5. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Stop Recording**: Click the button again to stop recording. The app will process the audio and display the transcribed text.
3. **View Transcription**: The recognized text appears on the screen in real-time.

## 📝 **Code Highlights**
- **Flask Backend**: Handles routing (`app.py`) and processes audio files using the `speech_recognition` library.
- **JavaScript (app.js)**: Manages audio capture, recording controls, and visualizes the waveform in real-time.
- **CSS Styling**: Creates an engaging and intuitive UI with visual feedback during recording.
